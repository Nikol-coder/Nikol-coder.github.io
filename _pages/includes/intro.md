Hi! I'm a third year Ph.D.Candidate from [Institute of Information Engineering,Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.iie.cas.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hongbo Xu](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0001857) and Prof. Yongxiu Xu. Iâ€™ve also interned at Xiaomi Corporation.

My research interest includes **Multimodal Knowledge Graph**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**, and **Information Retrieval and Extraction**. I am expected to complete my Ph.D. in June 2028, and will be actively seeking opportunities in both industry and academia. If you are interested, please feel free to get in touch.
