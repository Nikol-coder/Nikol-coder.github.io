Hi! I am a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://www.iie.ac.cn/">Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://liutingwen.ac.cn/">Tingwen Liu</a>. I've also interned at <a href="https://www.bytedance.com/zh/">ByteDance (TikTok)</a>, <a href="https://www.kuaishou.com/new-reco">Kuaishou</a> and <a href="https://research.baidu.com/">Baidu</a>.

My research focus on Recommendation Systems and LLMs. I am expected to complete my Ph.D. in June 2026, and will be actively seeking opportunities in both industry and academia. If you are interested, please feel free to get in touch.
