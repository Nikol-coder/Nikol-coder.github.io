Hi! I am a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://www.iie.ac.cn/">Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://liutingwen.ac.cn/">Tingwen Liu</a>. 

My research focus on Recommendation Systems, Graph Data Mining and LLMs. I am expected to complete my Ph.D. in June 2026, and will be actively seeking opportunities in both industry and academia. If you are interested, please feel free to get in touch.
